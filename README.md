# Spaceship Titanic Transport Prediction

## Description
This project develops a predictive model using machine learning to determine which passengers aboard the fictional Spaceship Titanic will be transported to an alternate dimension. The model is built with Python, utilizing libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, machine learning, and visualization.

## Installation
To run this project :
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Houssam-11/spaceship-titanic.git
    ```

## Usage
Navigate to the project directory and run each cell in the "app.ipynb" notebook to execute the model training and evaluation scripts.
This will train the model using the dataset provided and output the accuracy metrics and feature importance.
